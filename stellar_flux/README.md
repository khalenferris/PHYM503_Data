Key describing each stellar flux file.

Wilson_2021_Trappist1_sflux.txt is the stellar flux of the ultracool M-dwarf Trappist-1. It is taken from Wilson et al., (2021)
which describes the flux received from Trappist-1 at Earth. I scaled this data, via the inverse square law, to estimate the stellar flux incident on Trappist-1e from Trappist-1. This data was significantly more resolved than the default VULCAN stellar flux files. As a result, I took the flux data only for wavelengths that were included in the Gueymard_solar.txt file, which is included in VULCAN by default.
